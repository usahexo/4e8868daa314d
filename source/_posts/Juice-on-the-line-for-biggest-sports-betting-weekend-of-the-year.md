#  Juice on the line for biggest sports betting weekend of the year

From coast to coast, sports fans will be glued to their televisions and computers this weekend as the biggest games of the year take place. In addition to regular season finales in the NFL and college football, there are championship games in both sports that will determine the ultimate winners.

For sports bettors, this is undoubtedly the biggest weekend of the year. The potential payouts for correct predictions are massive, and there’s no shortage of tantalizing matchups to choose from.

Let’s take a look at some of the most interesting games on the board, and examine some of the betting odds for each one.

# NFL Week 17: The final week of the regular season is always a wild one, as teams scramble to clinch playoff spots or avoid relegation. This year is no exception, with several divisional championships on the line and several teams fighting for their lives.

The marquee matchup of Week 17 takes place in Seattle, where the Seahawks host the Dallas Cowboys. The Cowboys have already clinched a playoff spot, but they still have something to play for; if they can win out, they’ll capture home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. The Seahawks need a win to clinch a wildcard berth; otherwise they could miss out on the postseason altogether.

The Cowboys are currently 4-point favorites in this game, but don’t be surprised if that line moves before kickoff. Seattle has been one of the hottest teams in the NFL over the past few weeks, while Dallas has looked a little shaky at times.

Elsewhere in Week 17, a pair of divisional championships will be decided when the Baltimore Ravens visit Pittsburgh and Atlanta visits Carolina. The Steelers are currently 3-point favorites at home against Baltimore; these two teams have split their two previous meetings this year. In Carolina, the Panthers are slight 1-point favorites against Atlanta; Carolina has won both matchups against Atlanta this season.



# College Football Championship Weekend: There are four major conference championship games taking place this weekend, with title implications in all of them. In addition, two smaller conferences will also crown their champions on Saturday. Let’s take a look at each game:

# ACC Championship: Clemson Tigers vs Miami Hurricanes: This matchup has been circled on many fans’ calendars since September, when Clemson upset then-No.2 Miami 38-3 en route to an undefeated regular season. The Hurricanes have since recovered from that loss and earned a spot in the ACC championship game; they’ll be looking for revenge against Clemson on Saturday night.
Its worth noting that Miami is a 7-point favorite in this game; however, Clemson is 8-1 ATS in its last nine road gamesagainst AP Top 25 opponents .

 # Big 10 Championship: Wisconsin Badgers vs Ohio State Buckeyes: These two programs have a storied history dating back to 1916 ; Saturday’s matchup will be only their second meeting ever in the Big 10 championship game . Ohio State enters as a 7-point favorite ; Wisconsin is 5-1 ATS in its last six matchups against Ohio State . 

 # SEC Championship: Alabama Crimson Tide vs Georgia Bulldogs: This may be one of the most anticipated SEC championship games ever; both Alabama and Georgia were preseason top-5 teams and remain unbeaten heading into Saturday afternoon . Alabama is currently favored by 3 points , but don’t be surprised if that line moves before kickoff . 

 # Pac 12 Championship: Stanford Cardinal vs USC Trojans: These two teams met just last weekend , with USC winning 38-20 . However, that was before Stanford lost starting quarterback KJ Costello to injury ; backup QB Davis Mills should be ready to go for Saturday night’s rematch . USC is currently favored by 6 points ; Stanford is 5-1 ATS in its last six matchups against USC .

#  What is juice in sports betting and how does it work?

When someone talks about juice in sports betting, they are referring to the commission or "vig" that the bookmaker takes on a wager. This is also sometimes called the "overround". So when you see a line with -110 next to one team and +100 next to the other,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) that is the juice. In this example, the bettor would have to risk $110 to win $100.

The juice is essentially what allows bookmakers to make a profit and stay in business. It's why they can't just offer even money odds on every game and expect to turn a profit. The juice ensures that they make money regardless of the outcome of any given game.

There are a few different ways that bookmakers can set their juice. They can set it at a percentage of the total amount being wagered (known as "vigorish"), or they can set it at a fixed amount per bet (known as "juice"). Most sports books use vigorish, but there are some who use juice instead.

The key thing for bettors to understand is that the juice is always against them. That's why it's important to find lines where the juice is as low as possible. When you're able to find lines with no or negative juice, it's like getting free money.

#  NFL Week 8 betting: UNDERdogs with the best chance to pull off an upset

Dolphins (+6) at Texans

The Texans have been one of the NFL's most disappointing teams this season and that was on full display last week in their ugly home loss to the Colts. The Dolphins aren't a great team by any means, but they should be able to keep this game close. 6 points is just too many to give up against such a dysfunctional Houston squad.

Panthers (+3) at Bears

I'm not sure what has gotten into the Panthers over the past few weeks, but they have suddenly become one of the most reliable teams in the league. They have now won 4 out of their last 5 games and I expect them to keep that momentum going against Chicago this weekend. The Bears are a flawed team and I don't see them being able to keep up with Carolina.

Eagles (-3) at Jaguars

This game is a bit of a toss-up for me, but I'll give the edge to the Eagles. Jacksonville has been playing better as of late, but they are still not a very good team. Philadelphia is starting to gel as a unit and I think they will win this game relatively easily. 3 points is just too many to give up against such an inconsistent Jaguars squad.

#  Sharp bettors loving Broncos to cover against Chargers

Sharp bettors are all over the Broncos to cover the spread against the Chargers this Sunday.

The Broncos have been a good team to back against the spread this season, going 5-2 ATS. They are also coming off a big win over the Bengals, and will be looking to keep the momentum going against their division rivals.

The Chargers, on the other hand, have been struggling this season, going just 2-5 ATS. They have also lost three of their last four games, and are clearly outmatched heading into this matchup against the Broncos.

Given all of this, it is no surprise that sharp bettors are betting heavily on Denver to cover the spread in this game. The Broncos currently hold around 80% of the tickets in this game, and are expected to win by more than a touchdown.

#  College football Week 10 odds, picks: Auburn Tigers a big favorite

The Auburn Tigers will be looking for their fourth straight victory when they take on the Texas A&M Aggies this Saturday. The Tigers opened as a 21-point favorite and the line has held steady at that number.

Auburn (7-2) is coming off a bye week and looks to keep their momentum going after wins over Mississippi State, Ole Miss, and Louisiana-Monroe. The Aggies (5-4) have lost two of their last three games, with their only win in that stretch coming against Arkansas.

Texas A&M struggled mightily against Arkansas earlier this season, losing by a score of 52-6. The Aggies were held to just 196 yards of total offense in that game, while the Tigers put up 527 yards of total offense in their win over the Razorbacks.

The Auburn defense has been one of the best in the country this season, allowing just 281 yards per game (14th in the nation). They’ve been especially tough against the run, allowing just 97.8 yards per game (4th in the nation). Texas A&M QB Kellen Mond has been struggling lately, completing just 50% of his passes over his last three games.

The Auburn offense should be able to have success against the Aggies defense. The Tigers are averaging 446 yards per game this season (10th in the nation), with quarterback Jarrett Stidham throwing for 2,352 yards and 18 touchdowns on the year.

I expect Auburn to win this game by at least two touchdowns. The Tigers are a much better team than Texas A&M and I don’t see them having much trouble winning this one.
