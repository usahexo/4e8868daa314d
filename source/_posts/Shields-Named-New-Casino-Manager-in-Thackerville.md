The Choctaw Nation has announced that R.J. Shields has been named the new casino manager at the Riverwind Casino in Thackerville. Shields brings over two decades of casino experience to the position, most recently having served as general manager at the Wind Creek Casino in Wetumpka, Alabama.

“I am excited to welcome RJ to our team,” said Choctaw Nation Chief Gary Batton. “He has a long and successful track record in the casino industry and will be a great asset to Riverwind.”

Shields is looking forward to his new role, stating, “The Choctaw Nation has an incredible team and I am honored to be leading the Riverwind Casino. We are committed to providing our guests with an outstanding gaming experience and I look forward to working with my team to achieve this goal.”

The Riverwind Casino is located on tribal land in Thackerville, Oklahoma and features over 2,700 electronic games, 85 table games, and a 12-table poker room. The property also includes a 214-room hotel, spa, fitness center, and three restaurants.

#  Shields Takes Over Casino Management in Thackerville

The tribal casino and resort in Thackerville, Oklahoma has a new leader. Effective 12/1, Shields Collison is the new Director of the Casino. He replaces outgoing director and long-time tribe member Frank Hardesty.

Collison is no stranger to the gaming industry, having served as Vice President of Marketing for the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. In that role, he was responsible for all marketing activities for the company’s 10 resorts in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore, as well as its interactive and social gaming initiatives.

“I am excited about this opportunity to work with the tribe and its excellent team to continue driving the success of the casino and resort,” said Collison.

Collison’s appointment comes at a time of growth for the casino and resort. Earlier this year, it unveiled a $6 million expansion project that includes a new 24-hour restaurant, bar and lounge; an outdoor pool area with three cabanas; an expanded gift shop; and additional meeting space.

The casino also features over 1,000 electronic games, table games, a high-limit area and bingo. The resort offers 168 guest rooms and suites, five restaurants and two lounges, a fitness center and over 30,000 square feet of meeting space.
