#  What is the name of the protagonist in the novella? 

The protagonist in the novella is unnamed.

#  What are some names that Dr. Jekyll calls Mr. Hyde? 

Dr. Jekyll refers to his dark side as "Mr. Hyde." Other names he uses for Mr. Hyde include "the Beast," "the Monster," and "the Devil."

#  Where does Dr. Jekyll store Mr. Hyde? 

In Robert Louis Stevenson's novella, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, the titular doctor has a hidden alter ego that he stores in a cabinet in his laboratory. Jekyll can transform himself into Hyde at will, but he is fearful of what Hyde might do if he were ever to be unleashed.

Jekyll's lab is in the basement of his house and it is there that he has created a potion that allows him to change his appearance. He stores the vial containing the potion in a locked cabinet, along with other chemicals and equipment he needs to make more of the potion.

It is not clear where Hyde actually lives when Jekyll is not transformed into him, but it is possible that Jekyll has created a separate space for Hyde to reside in. This could be another part of the basement or even an entirely separate location altogether.

#  Why does Dr. Jekyll take potion? 

In the novella, Dr. Jekyll takes a potion in order to transform into Hyde. Jekyll needs to be able to separate the two halves of his personality and the potion is the only thing that can help him do that. Without it, he is stuck in a constant battle between good and evil.

Jekyll believes that it is better for everyone if he can keep his dark side hidden. He knows that Hyde is capable of terrible things, things that Jekyll would never do. By taking the potion, Jekyll is able to become someone else entirely, someone who is not burdened by the guilt and shame of his crimes.

While it is initially painful for Jekyll to split himself in two, over time he comes to see Hyde as a separate person, one who can be controlled. Hyde allows Jekyll to do the things that he would never do as himself and ultimately, that is why he keeps taking the potion.

#  Who ultimately kills Mr. Hyde?

There are many theories about who ultimately kills Mr. Hyde, but there is no definitive answer. Some say that it is Dr. Jekyll who kills Hyde, while others believe that Hyde murders Jekyll. There are also those who believe that it is someone else entirely who ends up killing Hyde. No one can be certain of the true identity of the killer, and the mystery remains unsolved.
