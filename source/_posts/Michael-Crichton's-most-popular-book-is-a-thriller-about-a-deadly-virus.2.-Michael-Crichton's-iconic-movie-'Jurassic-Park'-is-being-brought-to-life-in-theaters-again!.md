After the critical and commercial success of the Jurassic Park movie, it was only a matter of time before another Michael Crichton novel was turned into a movie. The Lost World is the sequel to Jurassic Park and tells the story of a team of scientists who travel to an island off the Costa Rican coast that is home to dinosaurs.

The first Lost World movie was released in 1997 and starred Jeff Goldblum, Julianne Moore, and Pete Postlethwaite. It was directed by Steven Spielberg and grossed over $611 million at the box office. A sequel, The Lost World: Jurassic Park III, was released in 2001 and starred Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and William H. Macy. It was directed by Joe Johnston and grossed over $229 million at the box office.
