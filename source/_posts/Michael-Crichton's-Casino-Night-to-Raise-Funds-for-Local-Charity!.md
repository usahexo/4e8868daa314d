#  Casino Night a Blast Thanks to Michael Crichton!

Casino night at our school is always a blast, but this year it was especially enjoyable because of Michael Crichton! His novel, " Jurassic Park ," provided the perfect backdrop for an evening of gaming and fun.

As the students piled into the cafeteria, they were greeted by a huge banner announcing casino night. Once they got their tokens, they were ready to hit the tables! Blackjack, poker, roulette- there was something for everyone.

And what would casino night be without some delicious snacks? The snack bar was definitely popular with all the gamers! There was everything from popcorn to cotton candy to pizza.

But the best part of casino night was definitely experiencing it all with your friends. It was great to see everyone laughing and having a good time. Thanks, Michael Crichton, for making our casino night so much fun!
