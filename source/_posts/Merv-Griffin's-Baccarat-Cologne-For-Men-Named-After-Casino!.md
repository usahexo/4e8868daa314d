#  Big Gamble: Merv Griffin Jumps Into The Cologne Game With Baccarat

Casualties were mounting on both sides of the Atlantic as the world engaged in the bloodiest conflict in human history. The stakes were high in the casino world as well, with fortunes won and lost on a daily basis. But one man risked it all in pursuit of even greater riches: Merv Griffin.

The son of a vaudeville performer, Griffin had already tasted success as a singer, actor, and TV producer before turning his attention to casinos. He first made his move into the gambling industry in 1963, when he acquired a stake in the Dunes Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. A few years later, he opened his own casino, the Griffin Gaming Company, in Reno.

But Griffin wanted to be bigger than just another casino operator. He was looking for an edge—a game that would give him an advantage over his competitors. And he found it in baccarat.

Baccarat had been popularized by Hollywood movies and high-roller gamblers like Bugsy Siegel, and it was fast becoming the king of casino games. Griffin recognized its potential and decided to get into the action. In 1969, he purchased half of a struggling baccarat casino in Cologne, Germany for $4 million.

At first, things didn't go well for Griffin. The casino was losing money hand over fist, and he was on the hook for half of its losses. But he refused to give up. He poured more money into the venture and revamped the operations. Within a few years, the casino was turning a profit and Griffin was sitting on a goldmine.

Griffin's success in Cologne led him to expand his baccarat operations into other European cities like London and Barcelona. And by the late 1970s, baccarat had become his most profitable game by far. He was making millions of dollars each year from his Cologne casino alone.

But as Griffin's fortune grew, so did his risk appetite. He began taking bigger and bigger gambles on baccarat games, betting ever larger sums of money in hopes of striking it rich. And sometimes he would win big; but more often than not, he would lose everything he had put up at stake.

In 1980, Griffin suffered one of his biggest setbacks when he lost $35 million playing baccarat at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas—nearly half of what he had earned from his Cologne casino over the previous decade! But rather than give up gambling altogether, Griffin doubled down on baccarat and continued to play—and lose—bigger and bigger stakes games throughout the 1980s.

By 1990, Griffin's debts had reached $1 billion and his casinos were struggling once again. This time there was no way out: In August 1990, Griffin filed for bankruptcy protection from his creditors.<img alt="BACCARAT" class="wp-image-433" src="https://www2-static-assets2-usdnbeerpondcom/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/BACCARAT-e1540878224877-1024x683jpg" width="1024" height="683">


  To this day, Merv Griffin is still remembered as one of America's most high-rolling gamblers—a man who went all in on baccarat and ended up losing millions of dollars in the process.<br><br>Despite his losses, however, Griffin can be credited with helping to popularize baccarat around the world and making it one of the most profitable games in casino history.<br><br>So next time you're playing at your favorite online casino , remember Merv Griffin: The man who risked it all on baccarat .
