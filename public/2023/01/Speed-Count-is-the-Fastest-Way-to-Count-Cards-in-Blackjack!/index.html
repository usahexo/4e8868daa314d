<h1 id="-2"><a href="#-2" class="headerlink" title=""></a></h1><p>If you’re looking for an edge over the casino, then Speed Count is the counting system for you!</p>
<h1 id="Speed-Count-is-Proven-to-Increase-your-Odds-of-Winning-by-Up-to-3-3-Speed-Count-Gives-You-an-Edge-at-the-Casino-Table"><a href="#Speed-Count-is-Proven-to-Increase-your-Odds-of-Winning-by-Up-to-3-3-Speed-Count-Gives-You-an-Edge-at-the-Casino-Table" class="headerlink" title="Speed Count is Proven to Increase your Odds of Winning by Up to 3%.3. Speed Count Gives You an Edge at the Casino Table!"></a>Speed Count is Proven to Increase your Odds of Winning by Up to 3%.3. Speed Count Gives You an Edge at the Casino Table!</h1><p>There are countless strategies that people use when playing casino games. But, there is one strategy that is proven to give players a better chance of winning – the Speed Count system.</p>
<p>Developed by gambling experts John Scarne and Don Schlesinger, Speed Count is a counting system that helps players to keep track of how many high cards are left in the deck. This information allows players to make better decisions about when to bet and when to fold.</p>
<p>The Speed Count system was originally designed for blackjack, but it can also be used for other casino games such as baccarat and roulette. In fact, Speed Count has been shown to increase a player’s odds of winning by up to 3%.</p>
<p>So, how does the Speed Count system work?</p>
<p>The basic concept is simple – you just need to keep track of the number of high cards that are left in the deck. As each high card is played, the number decreases, so you can make decisions about whether to bet or not based on this information.</p>
<p>For blackjack, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. And, with Speed Count, you can make better decisions about when to hit or stand based on the number of high cards that are left in the deck.</p>
<p>In general, you should stand if there are fewer than five high cards left in the deck, and hit if there are five or more high cards left in the deck. However, you may want to adjust these numbers depending on your own playing style and the specific rules of the game you are playing.</p>
<p>The beauty of Speed Count is that it is easy to learn and easy to use. In fact, you can start using it right away without having to memorize any complicated counting systems. And, because it relies mainly on intuition and common sense, you don’t have to be a mathematical genius to use it successfully.</p>
<p>So, if you want a better chance of winning at casino games, give Speed Count a try! It’s simple to learn and easy to use, and it can help you beat the casino at its own game.</p>

<p>What is Speed Counting?</p>
<p>Speed counting is a method of counting cards which allows players to keep track of the cards that have been played. This helps players to make better decisions about when to hit, stand, or fold. Speed counting is not as accurate as traditional card counting methods, but it is much simpler and can be used by beginners.</p>
<p>How do I Speed Count?</p>
<p>The easiest way to speed count is by using the following simple equation:</p>
<p> &#x3D; 1 for each low card (2-6) + 2 for each medium card (7-9) + 3 for each high card (10-Ace).</p>
<p>For example, if there are two 2s, three 3s, and an Ace played then the equation would be: 12 + 6 + 3 &#x3D; 21. This means that there are now 21 cards left in the deck.</p>
<p>As you can see, speed counting is very simple and easy to learn. It only takes a few minutes of practice to get the hang of it!</p>
<p>Why Should I Use Speed Counting?</p>
<p>There are several reasons why you should use speed counting when playing blackjack. Here are some of the benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is an easy way to keep track of the cards that have been played. - It can help you make better decisions about when to hit, stand, or fold. - It is a simple method which can be used by beginners. - It does not require as much accuracy as traditional card counting methods.</li>

<h1 id="5-Speed-Count-x3D-Winning-at-Blackjack"><a href="#5-Speed-Count-x3D-Winning-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="5. Speed Count &#x3D; Winning at Blackjack"></a>5. Speed Count &#x3D; Winning at Blackjack</h1><p>In blackjack, the player’s ultimate goal is to beat the dealer by scoring a higher total card value than the dealer, without exceeding 21. The game is played with one or more decks of 52 cards. After the players have placed their bets, the dealer deals two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer’s cards is face up and the other is face down.</p>
<p>The player’s hand consists of two cards, and the aim is to get as close to 21 as possible while not going bust (exceeding 21). Face cards (Jacks, Queens and Kings) are worth 10 points each, and an Ace can be counted as either 1 or 11 points. The second card in a player’s hand is called the “point value” of that hand. So if you are holding an Ace and a 4, your point value would be 5 (Ace&#x3D;1+4&#x3D;5).</p>
<p>If the first two cards add up to 21 or less, the player has a “blackjack” and automatically wins unless the dealer has blackjack as well; in which case it is a “push”. If the point value of the player’s hand exceeds 21 then he&#x2F;she busts and loses regardless of what the dealer’s final total is. If there are multiple players playing at once, then ties are resolved in favour of the banker (the dealer).</p>
<p>Now let’s take a look at how you can speed count in order to give yourself an advantage over the dealer. There are many different methods for counting cards, but we will focus on one of the simplest techniques called Hi-Lo. This method assigns a point score to every card from 2-6, with a score of 0 assigned to all other cards (7-Ace). So when you are dealt two initial cards, simply add up their total point values. If this number falls between 7-12 then you keep counting down until you reach 0; but if your total falls between 2-6 then you start counting up from 0 until you reach your total again. Take for example a starting hand of Ace-King: 1+11&#x3D;12 so this number gets reduced by 1 (down from 13) since 12 falls within 7-12 range on our chart. The next time you are dealt two new cards and they sum up to 6 points (2+4), that number would increase by 1 (up from 5) as 6 falls within 2-6 range on our chart. As long as you continue following this simple pattern, you will always know exactly how many points your current hand is worth!</p>
<p>Now armed with this information let’s look at how we can use it to our advantage while playing blackjack. In general, we want to stay away from hands that add up to more than 18 points (since they have a high likelihood of busting), while looking to take advantage of hands that add up to less than 12 points (since they offer us good odds of winning). If we know what our current point total is for any given hand, then we can easily make sound betting choices based on what we expect the dealer’s final total to be. For instance, if our point total is 6 then we would want to bet relatively low amounts since there is a good chance that the dealer has also drawn low value cards and thus will likely bust if they hit again. In contrast, if our point total was 11 then we would want to bet larger sums since there is now a smaller chance that the dealer will bust!</p>
<p>Speed counting can seem daunting at first but with some practice it becomes second nature. By using this simple technique you can give yourself a decided edge over the house and increase your chances of coming out victorious!</p>
