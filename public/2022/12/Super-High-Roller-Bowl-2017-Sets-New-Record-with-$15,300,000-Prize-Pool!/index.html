        <h1 id="Super-High-Roller-Bowl-2017-Sets-New-Record-with-15-300-000-Prize-Pool"><a href="#Super-High-Roller-Bowl-2017-Sets-New-Record-with-15-300-000-Prize-Pool" class="headerlink" title="Super High Roller Bowl 2017 Sets New Record with $15,300,000 Prize Pool!"></a>Super High Roller Bowl 2017 Sets New Record with $15,300,000 Prize Pool!</h1><p>The most prestigious and richest poker event in the world is back with a bang as the Super High Roller Bowl 2017 proves to be one of the biggest and most successful tournaments in its history. The astronomical prize pool of $15,300,000 smashed all expectations as some of the biggest name in poker battle it out for the top spot.</p>
<p>The star-studded lineup was headlined by none other than Daniel Negreanu who finished in 4th place for a cool $1,000,000. Other notables included Erik Seidel, Fedor Holz, Phil Ivey and Antonio Esfandiari. In the end it was Brian Rast who walked away with first place and the whopping first place prize of $4,830,000.</p>
<p>This year’s Super High Roller Bowl has taken over as the richest poker event in history and is a clear sign that this tournament is only going to get bigger and better in years to come. So make sure you mark your calendars for next year’s event – you won’t want to miss it!</p>
<h1 id="Sheldon-Adelson-Tops-All-Time-Poker-Earnings-List-With-over-25-Million-in-Winnings"><a href="#Sheldon-Adelson-Tops-All-Time-Poker-Earnings-List-With-over-25-Million-in-Winnings" class="headerlink" title="Sheldon Adelson Tops All-Time Poker Earnings List With over $25 Million in Winnings!"></a>Sheldon Adelson Tops All-Time Poker Earnings List With over $25 Million in Winnings!</h1><p>Sheldon Adelson became the all-time leading money winner in live poker tournament history on Thursday after taking down the $1 million buy-in “Big One for One Drop” event at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Europe.</p>
<p>The 83-year-old casino magnate from Las Vegas won a staggering $18,346,673 and pushed his career earnings past Phil Ivey’s previous record of $21,577,027. Runner-up Rainer Kempe collected a still impressive $10,112,001 payday.</p>
<p>Adelson is no slouch when it comes to playing poker. He has now cashed for over $25 million in live poker tournaments – an amazing achievement for any player, but all the more so for someone who doesn’t rely on the game as their main source of income.</p>
<p>Adelson entered the final table as one of the short stacks but managed to negotiate his way to victory after some tough play against some of the biggest names in poker. His heads-up opponent Kempe was seeking his first major title but eventually fell to Adelson’s relentless aggression.</p>
<p>Fellow American Bryn Kenney finished in 3rd place for $7,005,000 and Daniel Negreanu was 4th for $4,480,000. The remaining players at the final table all walked away with six-figure paydays, cementing this as one of the most lucrative poker tournaments in history.</p>
<p>The Big One for One Drop event is a high roller tournament that features a $1 million buy-in. The inaugural edition took place at the 2012 WSOP in Las Vegas and was won by Antonio Esfandiari who took home $18.3 million. That event proved to be a watershed moment for high roller tournaments and helped to establish them as a major attraction on the international poker circuit.</p>
<p>The next edition of the Big One for One Drop is scheduled to take place during the 2019 WSOP in Las Vegas and will once again feature a massive purse of over $10 million. With Adelson now sitting proudly atop the all-time money list, there will be plenty of players eager to take him down and claim top prize!</p>
<h1 id="Daniel-Negreanu-Grabs-Fourth-WSOP-bracelet-in-Historic-Victory"><a href="#Daniel-Negreanu-Grabs-Fourth-WSOP-bracelet-in-Historic-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Daniel Negreanu Grabs Fourth WSOP bracelet in Historic Victory!"></a>Daniel Negreanu Grabs Fourth WSOP bracelet in Historic Victory!</h1><p>On Saturday, Daniel Negreanu won his fourth World Series of Poker (WSOP) bracelet in a $25,000 buy-in no-limit hold’em event, topping a field of 183 players and besting high-roller specialist Fedor Holz heads up to take home the $1.4 million first prize.</p>
<p>It was an amazing victory for Negreanu, who is now just one bracelet behind Phil Hellmuth’s all-time record of 14 bracelets. What made it even more special was that Negreanu won in his home country of Canada, in front of a partisan hometown crowd at the Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“I’m so happy,” Negreanu said after the win. “To do it here in Canada is really special. I have so many friends and family here. It’s really awesome.”</p>
<p>This was also the second time that Negreanu has won a WSOP bracelet in a no-limit hold’em event; he previously won one in 2006. And given that no-limit hold’em is widely considered to be the most popular poker variant, this latest win only further cements Negreanu’s reputation as one of the greatest players in history.</p>
<p>In addition to his four bracelets, Negreanu has also finished runner-up at the WSOP four times and has earned over $32 million in career tournament earnings. He is also one of just two players (along with Phil Ivey) to have won poker’s “Triple Crown” – that is, victories in tournaments of different poker variants (hold’em, Omaha hi&#x2F;lo, Stud hi&#x2F;lo).</p>
<p>With his latest win, Negreanu has also moved up to second place on the all-time money list for live tournament poker earnings, behind only Antonio Esfandiari. And he shows no signs of slowing down; at 42 years old, Negreanu is still firmly among the younger generation of professional poker players.</p>
<h1 id="Phil-Ivey-Closes-In-On-Top-of-All-Time-Money-List"><a href="#Phil-Ivey-Closes-In-On-Top-of-All-Time-Money-List" class="headerlink" title="Phil Ivey Closes In On Top of All-Time Money List"></a>Phil Ivey Closes In On Top of All-Time Money List</h1><p>Phil Ivey, one of the most successful poker players in the world, continues to climb up the all-time money list.</p>
<p>Ivey is now in second place, just behind Erik Seidel. With more than $26 million in career winnings, Ivey is well on his way to becoming the all-time money leader.</p>
<p>Despite a rocky 2017, Ivey was able to win over $4 million in tournaments this year. He had some impressive victories, including first place at the partypoker MILLIONS World and the Triton SHR Series Bangkok.</p>
<p>Ivey is considered one of the best all-around players in the world. He is known for his exceptional skills in both cash games and tournaments.</p>
<p>Many poker experts believe that Ivey will eventually overtake Seidel as the all-time money leader. With his vast experience and consistent winning streak, there’s no doubt that Ivey is a force to be reckoned with on the poker table.</p>
<h1 id="Benny-‘The-Jet’-Wins-Another-Big-One-Moves-Up-The-Rankings"><a href="#Benny-‘The-Jet’-Wins-Another-Big-One-Moves-Up-The-Rankings" class="headerlink" title="Benny ‘The Jet’ Wins Another Big One, Moves Up The Rankings"></a>Benny ‘The Jet’ Wins Another Big One, Moves Up The Rankings</h1><p>It was a big weekend for Benny “The Jet” Rodriguez as he won his fourth consecutive professional MMA fight. This latest victory has catapulted him up the rankings, making him one of the top-rated light heavyweights in the world.</p>
<p>Benny started his career in mixed martial arts as a striker, relying on his speed and agility to overwhelm his opponents. But in his last few fights, he has shown a new level of grappling expertise, taking his opponents to the ground and submitting them with various chokeholds.</p>
<p>Many experts are now calling Benny a contender for the world championship title. His next fight is scheduled for later this year, and it will be interesting to see how he fares against some of the top-ranked fighters in the division.</p>
