<p>In fiscal year 2018, businesses earned $14,523,877 from video gambling machines. That’s a significant jump from the $11,724,023 businesses made from video gambling in fiscal year 2017.</p>
<p>The state’s total take from video gambling was also up in fiscal year 2018. The state earned $27,034,651 in revenue from video gambling in fiscal year 2018, compared to $23,992,574 in fiscal year 2017.</p>
<p>Video gambling is legal in Maryland under a 2012 law that allows slot machines at Anne Arundel County racetracks. The law was later expanded to allow video poker and other types of machines at certain locations in the state.</p>
<p>Businesses that have video gambling machines must pay the state a fee for each machine. In fiscal year 2018, businesses paid the state $5,511,774 in machine fees. That’s up from the $4,713,951 businesses paid in machine fees in fiscal year 2017.</p>
<p>The increase in business revenue and machine fees comes as no surprise to Scott Hardin of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Agency.</p>
<p>“The addition of table games at Live! Casino &amp; Hotel has helped grow the market for electronic gaming devices across the state as players look for new and different ways to gamble and spend their entertainment dollars,” Hardin said.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland’s-video-gambling-business-booming"><a href="#Maryland’s-video-gambling-business-booming" class="headerlink" title="Maryland’s video gambling business booming"></a>Maryland’s video gambling business booming</h1><p>Since the legalization of video gambling in Maryland in 2012, the industry has experienced a boom. Annual revenue from video gambling has grown from $27 million to $48 million, and the number of machines has quadrupled from 9,000 to 36,000.</p>
<p>The main beneficiaries of this growth have been bars and restaurants. In addition to generating tax revenue for the state, video gambling has also created jobs and supported business growth.</p>
<p>Opponents of video gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and social ills, but advocates say that it is a form of entertainment that can be enjoyed responsibly. They point to the fact that there are regulations in place to ensure that players are not harmed.</p>
<p>Maryland’s video gambling industry is obviously booming, and there doesn’t seem to be any sign of it slowing down anytime soon. Thanks for reading!</p>
<h1 id="Video-gambling-provides-big-boost-to-Maryland-businesses"><a href="#Video-gambling-provides-big-boost-to-Maryland-businesses" class="headerlink" title="Video gambling provides big boost to Maryland businesses"></a>Video gambling provides big boost to Maryland businesses</h1><p>Maryland businesses are reaping the rewards of video gambling, with sales up and profits soaring.</p>
<p>Businesses that offer video gambling say the machines have been a big hit since they were introduced in the state in 2014. They’ve provided a new stream of revenue for bars, restaurants, and other businesses that offer them.</p>
<p>Maryland is one of 25 states that allow some form of video gambling. The machines allow players to wager on games such as poker, blackjack, and slots.</p>
<p>According to the American Gaming Association (AGA), video gambling raked in more than $5 billion in revenue nationwide in 2017. That’s up from $4.5 billion in 2016 and $3.9 billion in 2015.</p>
<p>The uptick in revenue is being driven by an increase in the number of states that allow video gambling, as well as an increase in the number of machines per jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Businesses that offer video gambling say it has been a boon to their bottom lines. For example, Ronnie Kuchar, owner of Jokers Wild Casino and Bar &amp; Grill in Glen Burnie, Maryland, says his business was struggling before he installed video gambling machines. But since then, his business has seen sales growth of about 20 percent each year.</p>
<p>Kuchar says the machines bring people into his bar who might not have otherwise stopped by. They also provide a way for customers to blow off steam after work or on weekends.</p>
<p>“It gives them something else to do rather than just go home and watch TV or go out to eat somewhere else,” he said.</p>
<p>Video gambling has also been a boon to Maria’s Pizza &amp; Pasta in Dundalk, Maryland. Owner Maria Nasuti says her business has seen a 30 percent increase in sales since she installed six video gambling machines last year. And profits have soared by 50 percent.</p>
<p>Nasuti says the machines have brought new customers into her establishment, as well as regular customers who now spend more money when they visit her restaurant. Like Kuchar, she also believes the machines provide people with a diversion from their everyday lives.</p>
<p>“It gives them something to do where they can come out and socialize and maybe win some money too,” she said.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-businesses-see-surge-in-profits-from-video-gambling"><a href="#Maryland-businesses-see-surge-in-profits-from-video-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland businesses see surge in profits from video gambling"></a>Maryland businesses see surge in profits from video gambling</h1><p>MARYLAND – After legalizing video gambling in 2012, Maryland businesses are seeing a surge in profits.</p>
<p>The number of video gambling machines in the state has quadrupled since 2012, and business owners say the increase in profits is a direct result of the machines.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen a significant increase in revenue from video gambling over the past few years,” said Joe Barber, owner of J&amp;J’s Bar and Grill. “It’s been a big help to our bottom line.”</p>
<p>Maryland businesses installed 3,600 video gambling machines in 2017, up from just 900 in 2012. The state collected nearly $90 million in revenue from the machines last year, up from $22 million in 2012.</p>
<p>Most of that money goes to the state lottery, which receives 50% of all revenue generated by the machines. The remaining money is split between business owners and casino operators.</p>
<p>Businesses say they’re benefiting from the surge in profits, while opponents argue that the machines are addiction-forming and lead to negative social outcomes.</p>
<p>“Video gambling is a scourge on our communities,” said Delegate Pat McDonough. “These machines are nothing more than legalized slot machines, and they’re destroying families and costing taxpayers millions of dollars.”</p>
<p>Despite opposition from some segments of the population, business owners say they have no plans to remove the machines from their establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Maryland-businesses-benefit-from-video-gambling"><a href="#Maryland-businesses-benefit-from-video-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland businesses benefit from video gambling"></a>Maryland businesses benefit from video gambling</h1><p>Video gambling has been a contentious issue in Maryland for many years. There are many who feel that it is nothing more than a form of legalized gambling that preys on the addicted and poor, while providing no real benefits to the state. However, a recent study by the Milken Institute confirms what many Maryland business owners have known for some time – video gambling offers a real financial benefit to the state.</p>
<p>The study found that since video gambling was legalized in 2012, the industry has grown rapidly and generated nearly $1 billion in total revenue. This has led to the creation of nearly 5,000 new jobs in Maryland and over $100 million in tax revenue. In addition, businesses near video gambling establishments have seen an increase in sales and profits.</p>
<p>This is good news for Maryland businesses, which have been struggling to recover from the recession. The additional revenue and jobs created by video gambling will help to boost the economy and create much-needed jobs.</p>
<p>So far, it seems that the benefits of video gambling have outweighed the negative consequences. While there are always risks associated with any form of gambling, it appears that in this case, the positives outweigh the negatives. Maryland businesses should take advantage of this growing industry and its positive impact on the economy.</p>
