        <h1 id="NY-officials-debate-whether-or-not-to-legalize-wagering"><a href="#NY-officials-debate-whether-or-not-to-legalize-wagering" class="headerlink" title="NY officials debate whether or not to legalize wagering"></a>NY officials debate whether or not to legalize wagering</h1><p>The debate of whether or not to legalize wagering in New York has been ongoing for years. While some lawmakers are passionate about the idea, others remain skeptical.</p>
<p>Those in favor of legalizing gambling believe that it would bring new revenue to the state. They also argue that it would create jobs and boost the economy. However, those who oppose legalization claim that it could lead to increased crime and addiction rates.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a study was conducted by the Rockefeller Institute of Government which looked at the potential effects of legalizing sports betting in New York. The study found that if wagering was legalized, the state could expect to see an increase of $170 million in annual revenue.</p>
<p>Despite these findings, there is still significant opposition to legalizing wagering in New York. In March, lawmakers voted against a bill that would have allowed for sports betting at casinos and racetracks. Some lawmakers argued that the state should wait for guidance from the Supreme Court before moving forward with any legislation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court is expected to issue a ruling this summer on a case that challenges the legality of sports betting bans nationwide. If the court rules in favor of legalization, New York could move quickly to pass legislation authorising it within the state.</p>
<h1 id="Wagering-remains-illegal-in-New-York-despite-increasing-support"><a href="#Wagering-remains-illegal-in-New-York-despite-increasing-support" class="headerlink" title="Wagering remains illegal in New York despite increasing support"></a>Wagering remains illegal in New York despite increasing support</h1><p>The topic of gambling legalization has been hotly contested in the state of New York for years. On one side, those in favor of legalization argue that it would bring much-needed revenue to the state coffers. Opponents, however, argue that legalizing gambling would lead to an increase in addiction and social ills.</p>
<p>Despite increasing support, wagering remains illegal in New York. In November 2017, a bill that would have legalized casinos failed to pass the state Senate by a vote of 38-22. This was not the first time such a bill had been introduced; a similar measure was voted down by the state Assembly in 2016.</p>
<p>So why has gambling legalization failed to gain traction in New York? One reason may be the influence of lobbyist groups such as the Church Council of Greater New York, which has spoken out against legalization. The group argues that casinos would lead to increased crime and social ills, and that they would target low-income neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Another factor is the impact on local businesses. Casino operators fear that legalizing gambling would put them at a disadvantage vis-à-vis casinos in other states. And labor unions are concerned about the potential for job losses if casinos were to open up in New York.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there is growing support for legalizing gambling in New York, and it is likely only a matter of time before this happens. In the meantime, those who want to place bets can always do so online or through offshore operators.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-lags-behind-other-states-in-wagering-legalization"><a href="#New-York-lags-behind-other-states-in-wagering-legalization" class="headerlink" title="New York lags behind other states in wagering legalization"></a>New York lags behind other states in wagering legalization</h1><p>Though New York City is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world and its residents enjoy one of the highest per capita incomes, the state has been slow to legalize gambling. New Yorkers can currently only gamble at Indian casinos and the state lottery.</p>
<p>This may be changing soon, however, as a number of proposals for expanded gambling are making their way through the state legislature. Governor Andrew Cuomo has proposed allowing full-scale casino resorts in certain parts of the state, including ones in upstate New York and on Long Island.</p>
<p>While there is some opposition to gambling expansion, especially among those who live near potential casino resorts, polls suggest that a majority of New Yorkers support it. In particular, there is strong support for legalizing video lottery terminals (VLTs), which are slot machines that resemble video games.</p>
<p>Cuomo has argued that his proposal would create jobs and income tax revenue, both of which are sorely needed in upstate New York. He estimates that legalization of casinos and VLTs would generate $1.5 billion in new revenue each year.</p>
<p>Critics of gambling expansion argue that it will lead to increased crime rates and addiction problems. However, there is little evidence to support this claim. In fact, a study by the University of Illinois found that states with legalized gambling had lower crime rates than those without it.</p>
<p>So far, New York has not taken advantage of the many economic benefits that come with legalized gambling. With Governor Cuomo’s proposal and strong public support behind it, however, this may be about to change.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-revenue-is-New-York-losing-out-on-by-not-legalizing-wagering"><a href="#How-much-revenue-is-New-York-losing-out-on-by-not-legalizing-wagering" class="headerlink" title="How much revenue is New York losing out on by not legalizing wagering?"></a>How much revenue is New York losing out on by not legalizing wagering?</h1><p>A recent study by the Economics Research Company (ERC) suggests that New York could be losing out on as much as $1.3 billion in revenue by not legalizing wagering. The study, which was commissioned by the New York Gaming Association (NYGA), also found that the state could expect to create as many as 17,000 new jobs if it were to legalize sports betting and casino gaming.</p>
<p>According to the ERC’s analysis, New Yorkers are spending an estimated $2.6 billion annually on illegal wagers. If that money were to be wagered legally, the state could expect to earn taxes totaling between $416 million and $541 million per year. In addition, legalizing gaming would generate millions of dollars in license fees for the state and create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p>“The numbers don’t lie – New Yorkers want legalized games of chance, and they want them now,” said Sen. John DeFrancisco (R-Cicero), a co-chairman of the NYGA. “This report confirms what we’ve long known: Legalized gaming is a major economic driver, creating jobs and generating revenues for our schools and municipalities. It’s time for Albany to act on this issue and give New Yorkers the entertainment opportunities they want and deserve.”</p>
<p>Currently, there are nine states where casino gaming is legal – Nevada, New Jersey, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. In each of those states, gaming has been a major boon to the economy, generating millions of dollars in tax revenue and creating thousands of jobs.</p>
<p>New York is missing out on all of those benefits by failing to legalize gambling. If it did so, it could expect to see a significant increase in tax revenue while creating jobs across a variety of industries.</p>
<h1 id="Why-hasn’t-New-York-legalized-wagering-yet"><a href="#Why-hasn’t-New-York-legalized-wagering-yet" class="headerlink" title="Why hasn’t New York legalized wagering yet?"></a>Why hasn’t New York legalized wagering yet?</h1><p>While many states have legalized gambling in one form or another, New York has yet to do so. There are a few reasons for this.</p>
<p>First, there is the potential for negative effects on society. Some people believe that legalized gambling can lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>Second, there is money to be made from gambling. The state government could stand to lose out on revenue if it were to legalize wagering.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the issue of regulation. It would be up to the state government to regulate gambling, and it is not clear that they have the resources or the expertise to do so effectively.</p>
