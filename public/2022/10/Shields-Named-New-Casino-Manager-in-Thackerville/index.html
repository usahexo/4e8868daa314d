Shields has been named the new casino manager at the Riverwind Casino in Thackerville. Shields brings over two decades of casino experience to the position, most recently having served as general manager at the Wind Creek Casino in Wetumpka, Alabama.</p>
<p>“I am excited to welcome RJ to our team,” said Choctaw Nation Chief Gary Batton. “He has a long and successful track record in the casino industry and will be a great asset to Riverwind.”</p>
<p>Shields is looking forward to his new role, stating, “The Choctaw Nation has an incredible team and I am honored to be leading the Riverwind Casino. We are committed to providing our guests with an outstanding gaming experience and I look forward to working with my team to achieve this goal.”</p>

<p>Their son Casey is now taking the helm and is looking forward to bringing his experience to the Casino Oklahoma. “We’re excited about this opportunity to revitalize the property and give our guests a world-class gaming experience,” he said.</p>
<p>The Shields are no strangers to Thackerville, having opened the Riverwind Casino just down the road in 1998. That property has since become one of the most successful casinos in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The Casino Oklahoma is currently closed for renovations, but is scheduled to reopen this summer with new restaurants, gaming floors, and a hotel.</p>
